    <h3>How the Brain Adapts and Changes</h3>
    
    

    <p>
        Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize itself in response to experiences, learning, and injury.
        This remarkable property allows the brain to form new neural connections throughout life, enabling recovery from traum and adaptation to new environments.
        <br>
        <br>
        Neuroplasticity is particularly prominent during childhood, a period when the brain is rapidly developing and learning new skills.
        However, recent research has shown that adults also retain significant plasticity, allowing them to continue learning and adapting well into old age.

        <ul>
            <li>Age: Younger brains are generally more plastic than older ones.</li>
